# OAuth Credentials Setup

## Place Your OAuth Client Credentials Here

1. Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials
2. Create OAuth Client ID → Desktop App
3. Download the JSON file
4. Save it as `oauth_client.json` in this `data/` folder

## Generate Tokens

After placing `oauth_client.json` here, run:

```bash
cd backend
python generate_token.py
```

This will:
- Open a browser window
- Ask you to sign in with YOUR Google account
- Generate refresh token and access token
- Display the values to add to your `.env` file

## Files in This Directory

- `oauth_client.json` - OAuth client credentials (downloaded from Google Cloud Console)
- **DO NOT** commit this file to Git (already in .gitignore)

## Important Notes

- The `oauth_client.json` file contains your OAuth client ID and secret
- The refresh token (generated by `generate_token.py`) goes in your `.env` file, not here
- Never share these files publicly
- The refresh token never expires - you only need to generate it once
